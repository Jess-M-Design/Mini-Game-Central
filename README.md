## Overview
Mini Game Central is a browser-based arcade hub built to deliver quick, engaging mini-games through a clean and responsive interface. It was designed and developed as part of a personal creative coding initiative focused on interactive user experience, front-end development skills, and visual engagement.
Goals
- Create a centralized, user-friendly interface for hosting multiple mini-games.

- Prioritize responsive design to ensure seamless access across desktop and mobile devices.

- Implement consistent visual branding across game tiles and modals.

- Simplify game navigation to encourage replayability.



## ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience
Casual web users looking for fun, lightweight, and accessible games without the need for downloads or accounts. Ideal for short breaks or sparking creativity through play.


### Features
- Interactive Game Cards: Each game is displayed with an animated tile that draws attention but doesnâ€™t overwhelm.

- Modal System: Custom modal windows guide users through game start and end states with clear call-to-actions.

- Responsive Layout: Built with media queries and flexbox/grid techniques to support all screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktops.

- Game Variety: Includes games like Hangman and other simple arcade-style experiences with easy-to-learn mechanics.



## Design Process
1. Wireframing & Layout
I started with low-fidelity wireframes to establish the homepage layout and user flow from browsing to playing and restarting a game. The key was simplicity: one click from homepage to gameplay.
2. Visual Design
Color palette: A high-contrast, vibrant set of colors for game tiles to add personality.


Typography: Bold, easy-to-read fonts to enhance accessibility.


Icons & Animations: CSS hover effects bring tiles to life, creating a "fan" or expansion animation that adds energy to the homepage without being disorienting.


3. Interactivity & UX
The hover animations stretch game tiles to the right and dynamically shift surrounding tilesâ€”creating a fan-out effect. The intention was to mimic physical movement in a digital space to make exploration feel tactile.

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack
- HTML5 & CSS3: Semantic structure and modern responsive design.

- JavaScript/jQuery: DOM manipulation, event handling, and simple game logic.

- GitHub Pages: Hosting the static site with version control via GitHub.


## Challenges
- Responsive Design Conflicts: Ensuring hover animations did not break the grid layout on smaller screens required careful restructuring with flex-wrap and media queries.

- Modal Trapping: Preventing interaction outside of modals required custom jQuery logic to disable background events until a user clicks a button.



## Outcome
Mini Game Central is a fun, interactive project that reflects my ability to combine visual design with JavaScript-based game logic. The platform is currently live and open to further additions, including more games, themes, and accessibility improvements.


## ðŸš€ Next Steps

- Expand the game library with multiplayer or puzzle-based challenges.

- Integrate local storage to track scores or user progress.

- Refactor to use vanilla JS or a modern front-end framework like React.
